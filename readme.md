#Harness Property Technical Test (Front End)

Greetings fellow developer. Our business fallen into trouble and requires your assistance dealing with some nasty bugs! Business analyst identified four most persistent threats and calculated ranked values for each one. Details about bugs can be found in doodles.json file.

We must now decide which bug is most important to be able to prioritize our efforts, for this reason we require a comparison tool between different types of bugs.

*	Designs about different bugs are provided in .pdf visual file.
*	To make your life easier we also provided you with styles and mark up for application.

##The task
*	Write application that uses JavaScript to compare different bugs from doodles.json file.
*	Maximum of two bugs can be selected at any time.
*	If only one bug is selected it should appear on the left-hand side in comparison area.
*	Every bug has different stats, a visual colour indicator should highlight greater value of two bugs.
*	Even or neutral values should be coloured grey.
*	Bugs also can be sorted by name and by team name; Selected bug state should not be lost when sorting; There are two different options for sorting: Ascending and Descending.
*	Please provide installation instructions in readme.md file.
##Scoring criteria
*	Less is more; There should be no unnecessary code. 
*	Nice and logical formatting.
*	Vanilla JavaScript is favoured over frameworks such as React or AngularJS(2).
*	Please don’t use any jQuery.
*	Comments are appreciated but not necessary. Self-documenting code and well named variables are favoured.
*	Size matters – Application bellow 23 requests; 432KB in size and load < 220ms will get additional points.
*	Unit tests are extra points but not required.
